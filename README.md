# Eye-Controlled-Onscreen-Keyboard-for-People-with-Disabilities

This project proposes an eye-controlled onscreen keyboard designed to assist people with disabilities, such as quadriplegia or cerebral palsy. The goal is to enhance independence in interacting with technology for people with disabilities (PWD) in the Middle East. The keyboard uses computer vision to detect eye movements, with letter selection done through blinking. 

To increase typing speed, we have implemented a "divide and conquer" method for letter selection. While the keyboard may not provide full independence, it is an important step toward improving accessibility.

### Keyboard Design
